\section{Results}
Using the aforementioned analysis procedure we found resulting communities and their related collocations and SIPs for a number of search terms.  We describe one such complete workflow for a political community centered around Glenn Beck.

\subsection{Glenn Beck}
Glenn Beck is a controversial conservative cable television show host on the Fox News network.  We performed a strong pair search for users who used both ``Glenn'' and ``Beck'' in at least one directed twit.  We then grew communities from the set of the 38 seed pairs that resulted, using the recursive community growth algorithm described above.  We expected that because of Glenn Beck's controversial nature we would be able to find distinct communities with little or no cross interaction.

  \caption{The reduced graph for one of the five major communities found for the the Glenn Beck search.  Edges which did not meet a minimum weight were pruned from the graph.  If a node was unconnected after pruning it does not appear in the graph.  The node labels are the users unique Twitter IDs.}
