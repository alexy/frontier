\section{Results}
Using the aforementioned analysis procedure we found resulting communities and their related collocations and SIPs for a number of search terms.  The graphs for these networks are large, and the full versions can be viewed at HTTP://WEBSITE.ADDRESS.\\
\subsection{Glenn Beck}
Glenn Beck is a controversial conservative cable television show host on the Fox News network.  We performed a strong pair search for users who used both "Glenn" and "Beck" in at least one directed tweet.  We then grew communities from the set of 38 user pairs that resulted using the recursive community growth algorithm.  We hoped that because of Mr. Beck's controversial nature we would be able to find distinct communities with likely little or no cross interaction.  The interconnected graph of the communities we found is below.\\

Given these communities we then performed a Collocation analysis.\\
