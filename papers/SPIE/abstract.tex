Social Networks generally provide an implementation of some kind of groups or communities which users can voluntarily join.  Twitter does not have this functionality, and there is no notion of a formal group or community.  We propose a method for identification of communities and assignment of semantic meaning to the discussion topics of the resulting communities.\\
Using this analysis method and a sample of roughly a month's worth of Tweets from Twitter's Gardenhose feed, we demonstrate the discovery of meaningful user communities on Twitter.\\
