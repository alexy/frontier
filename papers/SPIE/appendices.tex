\section{Full Glenn Beck Community Graph}
Due to page size limitations, the full graph of the 5 interacting Glenn Beck communities is contained here in the Appendix A.  As you can see, three of the larger communities are closely intertwined, while one of the large communities is discrete.  There is also a small community which is not connected to either.  This result was what we were hoping for with the Glenn Beck search -- we had hoped to find distinct communities which did not interact with each other -- and was what we had expected with a controversial figure like Beck.
